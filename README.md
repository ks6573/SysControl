# SysControl

An AI agent for your Mac that answers questions about your system — and can extend itself with new tools on the fly.

65 real-time tools covering CPU, RAM, GPU, disk, network, processes, iMessage, clipboard, browser, weather, reminders, Docker, Time Machine, Wi-Fi, calendar, contacts, shell, spreadsheets, Word documents, PDFs, deep web research, and more. The agent picks the right tools automatically, runs them in parallel, and answers in plain English.

Three ways to run it — pick whichever fits your workflow:

| | How | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **App** | [Download the `.app`](#app-recommended) | One-click native macOS experience — no setup required |
| **CLI** | `uv run agent.py` | Terminal-first workflow, scripting, SSH sessions |
| **Claude Desktop** | MCP server | Using SysControl tools inside Claude Desktop |

All interfaces share the same agent, tools, and providers — they're interchangeable.

---

## App (Recommended)

A native SwiftUI app with streaming chat, Markdown rendering, chat history sidebar, and auto-save — no Python, no terminal, no dependencies to install. Just download, open, and configure your provider in Settings.

### Download

**Option A — Pre-built DMG** (no Xcode required):

Download the latest `SysControl.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ks6573/Syscontrol/releases), drag to Applications, then bypass Gatekeeper on first launch (the app is ad-hoc signed, not notarized):

```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SysControl.app
```

Or right-click the app → **Open** → **Open** the first time.

**Option B — Install from source** (compiles locally, bypasses Gatekeeper automatically):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ks6573/Syscontrol/master/swift/install.sh)"
```

To update later: use **Check for Updates** in the app (⇧⌘U), or run `syscontrol-update` from Terminal.

To uninstall: re-run with `--uninstall`.

**Option C — Build manually:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ks6573/Syscontrol.git
cd Syscontrol/swift
./build.sh release
open .build/SysControl.app
```

> **Requires:** macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later. Options B and C also require Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

### Features

- **Streaming responses** — tokens appear as they arrive with live Markdown rendering
- **Auto-save** — every conversation is saved automatically with an LLM-generated title
- **Chat history sidebar** — browse and delete past chats
- **Settings** — switch between local (Ollama) and cloud providers in-app
- **In-app updates** — check for new versions from the menu bar (⇧⌘U) or Settings; DMG users get a one-click download, source-install users update automatically
- **No setup** — everything is configured through the app itself

### First Launch

On first launch an onboarding sheet appears automatically:

1. Choose **Local (Ollama)** — requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally, no API key needed
2. Or choose **Cloud** — enter your API key
3. Click **Done** and start chatting

To change providers later, open **Settings** (⌘,).

> Chat history is saved as Markdown in `~/.syscontrol/chat_history/` — view, edit, or delete freely.

---

## Requirements (CLI only)

- Python **3.11** or later
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) package manager
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (local mode) **or** an Ollama Cloud API key (cloud mode)

---

## Installation (CLI only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ks6573/Syscontrol.git
cd Syscontrol

# Install uv if needed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

uv sync
```

---

## Terminal Agent

```bash
uv run agent.py
```

### CLI Flags

```bash
uv run agent.py                                          # interactive
uv run agent.py --provider local --model qwen3:30b      # local, skip prompt
uv run agent.py --provider cloud --api-key sk-...       # cloud, skip prompt
```

### Local Mode (Ollama)

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:30b   # recommended
ollama serve
uv run agent.py --provider local
```

**Tool-calling capable models:**

| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| `qwen3:30b` | Default. Best tool use and reasoning |
| `qwen3:8b` | Faster, lower memory — includes thinking mode |
| `qwen2.5:7b` | Lightweight alternative |
| `llama3.1:8b` | Battle-tested fallback |

> Models without native tool-calling (e.g. `gemma3`) will error.

### Cloud Mode (Ollama Cloud)

```bash
uv run agent.py --provider cloud
# Enter your key when prompted — not echoed or stored in shell history
```

Get a key at [ollama.com/settings/keys](https://ollama.com/settings/keys). Default cloud model: `gpt-oss:120b`.

### Ending a Session

Say any natural goodbye (`bye`, `exit`, `quit`, `done`, `farewell`, `cya`, `goodnight`, …) or press **Ctrl-C**. The agent will offer to save your session before exiting.

### Session Memory

On exit you are prompted to save a short note about the session. Notes are appended to `SysControl_Memory.md` with a timestamp. On next startup, if the file exists its contents are injected into the system prompt so the agent has context from prior sessions. The file is append-only and plain text — edit or delete entries freely.

The agent can also save and recall memory mid-session via the `read_memory` and `append_memory_note` tools — no need to wait for exit.

> **Privacy:** SysControl stores only what you explicitly save. Ollama processes queries locally by default.

---

## Permissions & Security

Sensitive tools are **disabled by default**. Enable them in `~/.syscontrol/config.json`:

```json
{
  "allow_shell":           true,
  "allow_messaging":       true,
  "allow_message_history": true,
  "allow_screenshot":      true,
  "allow_file_read":       true,
  "allow_file_write":      true,
  "allow_calendar":        true,
  "allow_contacts":        true,
  "allow_accessibility":   true,
  "allow_tool_creation":   true,
  "allow_deep_research":   true
}
```

Each disabled tool returns an error with the exact flag needed to enable it.

## Claude Desktop Setup

**1. Add the MCP server to your config**

| Platform | Config path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "system-monitor": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv",
      "args": ["run", "/absolute/path/to/Syscontrol/mcp/server.py"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Use `which uv` to get the uv path.

**2. Set the system prompt** — create a Claude Desktop Project and paste the contents of `mcp/prompt.json` into the Project Instructions field.

**3. Restart Claude Desktop** — `system-monitor` will appear in the MCP servers list.

---

## Self-Extension

When you ask for something no tool covers, the agent offers to build it:

```
You: What song is playing in Spotify right now?

Agent: I don't have a tool for that. Want me to create one? (yes/no)

You: yes

Agent: ✓ Tool `get_spotify_track` installed. Restart and ask again.
```

The agent writes a Python function, validates syntax, scans for dangerous patterns (`eval`, `exec`, etc.), and appends it to `mcp/server.py`. Requires:

```json
{ "allow_tool_creation": true }
```

│  (swift/SysControl/) │   Onboarding, chat, settings, history
└────────┬─────────────┘

└────────┬─────────────┘
         │  JSON-RPC (stdio)
┌────────▼─────────────┐
│    MCP Server        │   64 tools, self-extension, permission checks
│  (mcp/server.py)     │   Concurrent tool execution via client pool
└──────────────────────┘
```

The Swift frontend communicates with the Python backend through `agent/bridge.py`, which speaks a simple JSON-over-stdio protocol. The bridge reuses the same `MCPClientPool` and streaming loop used by the CLI, so all tools and capabilities are shared across every interface.
